One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nGordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\n<image>"

How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds. The answer is B."

Choose the most likely ratio.\nContext: This passage describes the fleece type trait in sheep:\nThe fleece, or outer coat, of a sheep is often cut off and used to make yarn for fabrics and other textiles. Woolly fleeces, which have shorter hairs, are usually used for clothing and blankets. Hairy fleeces, which have longer hairs, are usually used for carpets.\nIn a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep.\nOptions: (A) 0:4 (B) 4:0 (C) 2:2 (D) 1:3 (E) 3:1\n<image>"

        "value": "Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a woolly fleece or a hairy fleece, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for a hairy fleece, is dominant over the f allele, which is for a woolly fleece.\nA woolly fleece is the recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the recessive version of the fleece type trait must have only recessive alleles for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a woolly fleece must have the genotype ff.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.\nA hairy fleece is the dominant allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the dominant version of the fleece type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a hairy fleece must have the genotype FF or Ff.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a woolly fleece. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a hairy fleece. The answer is B."

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with smooth fruit or fuzzy fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for smooth fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for fuzzy fruit.\nSmooth fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A tomato plant with the dominant version of the fruit texture trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with smooth fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff.\nFuzzy fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A tomato plant with the recessive version of the fruit texture trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with fuzzy fruit must have the genotype ff.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with smooth fruit to offspring with fuzzy fruit is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with smooth fruit. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with fuzzy fruit. The answer is D."

For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals or rocks.\nHumans are organisms too. So, substances that humans make by hand or in factories are not minerals or rocks.\nA mineral is a pure substance, but a rock is not.\nA pure substance is made of only one type of matter. Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.\nHowever, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a normal-sized body or a dwarf body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body size trait. The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a dwarf body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a normal-sized body.\nA normal-sized body is the dominant allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the dominant version of the body size trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body size gene. So, offspring with a normal-sized body must have the genotype BB or Bb.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.\nA dwarf body is the recessive allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the recessive version of the body size trait must have only recessive alleles for the body size gene. So, offspring with a dwarf body must have the genotype bb.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a normal-sized body. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a dwarf body. The answer is B."

The pine vole also has an arrow pointing to it from the swallowtail caterpillar, which is a consumer. The pine vole eats a producer and a consumer, so it is an omnivore.\nThe silver maple does not have any arrows pointing to it. So, the silver maple is not an omnivore.\nThe black racer has only one arrow pointing to it. This arrow starts from the pine vole, which is a consumer. So, the black racer is a consumer but not an omnivore. The answer is D."

Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. Air is a gas. The water in a glass is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in.\nIf you pour water from a glass into a different container, the water will take the shape of that container.

Earth's volume is 1.08 x 10^12 km^3. Earth's volume is the only volume with an exponent of 12.\nThe volumes of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune have exponents greater than 12, so these four planets are larger than Earth.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.

In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.\nTo compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents.

For example:\n1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15\nTo multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent.

When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.\nMembranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.\nSo, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal. Look at the diagram again.

They can help you find places on globes and maps.\nLines of latitude show how far north or south a place is. We use units called degrees to describe how far a place is from the equator. The equator is the line located at 0\u00b0 latitude. We start counting degrees from there.\nLines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.\nLines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0\u00b0 longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.\nThe equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180\u00b0E and 180\u00b0W.\nTogether, lines of latitude and lines of longitude form a grid. You can use this grid to find the exact location of a place. The prime meridian is the line at 0\u00b0 longitude. It intersects Africa. It does not intersect North America or South America. The answer is B."

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black fur or brown fur, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fur color trait. The question tells you that the f allele, which is for brown fur, is recessive to the F allele, which is for black fur.\nBlack fur is the dominant allele's version of the fur color trait. A rabbit with the dominant version of the fur color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fur color gene. So, offspring with black fur must have the genotype FF or Ff.\nThere are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff. These boxes are highlighted below.\nBrown fur is the recessive allele's version of the fur color trait. A rabbit with the recessive version of the fur color trait must have only recessive alleles for the fur color gene. So, offspring with brown fur must have the genotype ff.\nThere is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype ff. This box is highlighted below.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with black fur to offspring with brown fur is 3:1.

Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.\nAs a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.\nMembranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.\nSo, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal. Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.\nBefore the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 3 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 5 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.\nWhen the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the left side of the membrane than before.\nSo, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

A year after the last fire, Dr. Spencer counted the number of unwanted grasses in each of the six plots.\nHint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating.

For example, imagine that you want to find out if fertilizer affects the number of tomatoes a tomato plant grows. To answer this question, you decide to set up two equal groups of tomato plants. Then, you add fertilizer to the soil of the plants in one group but not in the other group. Later, you measure the effect of the fertilizer by counting the number of tomatoes on each plant.\nIn this experiment, the amount of fertilizer added to the soil and the number of tomatoes were both variables.\nThe amount of fertilizer added to the soil was an independent variable because it was the variable whose effect you were investigating. This type of variable is called independent because its value does not depend on what happens after the experiment begins. Instead, you decided to give fertilizer to some plants and not to others.\nThe number of tomatoes was a dependent variable because it was the variable you were measuring. This type of variable is called dependent because its value can depend on what happens in the experiment. The answer is A."

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with yellow pods or green pods, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the pod color trait. The question tells you that the d allele, which is for yellow pods, is recessive to the D allele, which is for green pods.\nYellow pods is the recessive allele's version of the pod color trait. A pea plant with the recessive version of the pod color trait must have only recessive alleles for the pod color gene. So, offspring with yellow pods must have the genotype dd.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype dd.\nGreen pods is the dominant allele's version of the pod color trait. A pea plant with the dominant version of the pod color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the pod color gene. So, offspring with green pods must have the genotype DD or Dd.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype DD or Dd.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with yellow pods to offspring with green pods is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with yellow pods. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with green pods. The answer is C."

How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds. The answer is B."

The sticks represent the chemical bonds between the atoms.\nNotice how each ball is labeled with a symbol made of one or more letters. The symbol is an abbreviation for a chemical element. The ball represents one atom of that element.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.\nThe molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.\nThe chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.\nIn chemical formulas, the subscripts are numbers. The subscript is always written after the symbol for an element. The subscript tells you how many atoms that symbol represents. If the symbol represents just one atom, then no subscript is included.\nThe symbols in the chemical formula for a molecule match the symbols in the ball-and-stick model for that molecule.

This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with two hydrogen atoms and two oxygen atoms.\nThe chemical formula will contain the symbols H and O. There are two hydrogen atoms, so H will have a subscript of 2. There are two oxygen atoms, so O will have a subscript of 2.\nThe correct formula is H2 O2.\nThe diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above.

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nErnest was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Ernest put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\n<image>"

She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds. The answer is B."

Pamela soaked white linen fabric squares in five of the buckets, and white cotton fabric squares in the other five buckets. All of the fabric squares were soaked for 15 minutes. After the fabric dried, Pamela scored the darkness of the squares on a scale from light to dark. She compared the darkness of the linen fabric to the darkness of the cotton fabric.\nFigure: fabric that has been dyed black.\nOptions: (A) Does fabric turn darker when soaked in a mixture of black dye and water for 15 minutes compared to 30 minutes?

In order to do this, you need to figure out what was tested and what was measured during the experiment.\nImagine an experiment with two groups of daffodil plants. One group of plants was grown in sandy soil, and the other was grown in clay soil. Then, the height of each plant was measured.\nFirst, identify the part of the experiment that was tested. The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.\nThen, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.\nExperiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.\nExamples of questions that this experiment can answer include:\nDoes soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?\nDo daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?\nAre daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil? The answer is B."

A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas. The helium in a balloon is also a gas. The air moving through a trombone is a gas. A gas expands to fill a space.\nThe air in a trombone expands to fill all the space inside the trombone.

Each particle in sample A has more mass than each particle in sample B. The particles in sample A also have a higher average speed than the particles in sample B. So, the particles in sample A have a higher average kinetic energy than the particles in sample B.\nBecause the particles in sample A have the higher average kinetic energy, sample A must have the higher temperature.

The ball represents one atom of that element.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own symbol. For some elements, that symbol is one capital letter. For other elements, it is one capital letter followed by one lowercase letter. For example, the symbol for the element boron is B and the symbol for the element chlorine is Cl.\nThe molecule shown above has one boron atom and three chlorine atoms. A chemical bond links each chlorine atom to the boron atom.\nThe chemical formula for a molecule contains the symbol for each chemical element in the molecule. Many chemical formulas use subscripts. A subscript is text that is smaller and placed lower than the normal line of text.\nIn chemical formulas, the subscripts are numbers. The subscript is always written after the symbol for an element. The subscript tells you how many atoms that symbol represents. If the symbol represents just one atom, then no subscript is included.\nThe symbols in the chemical formula for a molecule match the symbols in the ball-and-stick model for that molecule. The ball-and-stick model shown before and the chemical formula shown above represent the same substance. B is the symbol for boron. F is the symbol for fluorine. This ball-and-stick model shows a molecule with one boron atom and three fluorine atoms.\nThe chemical formula will contain the symbols B and F. There is one boron atom, so B will not have a subscript. There are three fluorine atoms, so F will have a subscript of 3.\nThe correct formula is BF3.\nThe diagram below shows how each part of the chemical formula matches with each part of the model above. The answer is A."

Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.\nAs a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.\nMembranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.\nSo, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal. Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.\nBefore the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 6 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 2 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.\nWhen the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the right side of the membrane than before.\nSo, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the right than to the left.

The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets. Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.\nThere is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1.

The part of an experiment that is tested usually involves the part of the experimental setup that is different or changed. In the experiment described above, each group of plants was grown in a different type of soil. So, the effect of growing plants in different soil types was tested.\nThen, identify the part of the experiment that was measured. The part of the experiment that is measured may include measurements and calculations. In the experiment described above, the heights of the plants in each group were measured.\nExperiments can answer questions about how the part of the experiment that is tested affects the part that is measured. So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.\nExamples of questions that this experiment can answer include:\nDoes soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?\nDo daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?\nAre daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil?

Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.\nAs a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.\nMembranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.\nSo, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal. Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.\nBefore the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 2 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 6 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.\nWhen the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There were 2 more solute particles on the left side of the membrane than before.\nSo, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the left than to the right.

For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning.\nOperant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past.

Millions of people have welcomed cats into their homes. Indeed, researchers believe that the relationship between cats and humans goes back to prehistoric times. But throughout history, different cultures and people around the world have had different sentiments about cats. Such feelings have ranged from fear to worship.\nPeople probably first developed friendly relationships with cats around eight thousand years ago, when farming and agriculture had just started to develop in the Middle East. Farmers were growing and storing grain, which in turn attracted mice and other pests. Cats were wild then. However, they were likely drawn to farming communities because there were mice to hunt. The farmers would have noticed and appreciated these visitors. To keep the cats around, these early farmers may have given food and even shelter to the wild cats. The farmers and cats probably helped one another.\nIt wasn't until five thousand years later that the Egyptians started to treat cats as pets. Cats in ancient Egypt were not simply valued, but considered sacred. In paintings, many Egyptian goddesses took the form of cats. People who were caught harming cats were punished severely. Some cats were even made into mummies when they died. Normally, only the richest and most powerful people were buried this way.\nLater in history, some societies thought of the cat as evil. In Europe during the Middle Ages, black cats were especially feared. Some believed that witches turned themselves into black cats at night. The connection between witches and black cats lasted for many years. The idea traveled from Europe to North America as Europeans settled there. However, today cats of all colors are beloved by millions of people worldwide. In fact, the way some house cats are treated now might make their Egyptian ancestors jealous!\nOptions: (A) The cats were thought to be visiting goddesses. (B) The cats hunted and brought food to the farmers. (C) The cats helped keep the farmers' grain free of mice. (D) The cats helped farmers find better places to store grain.\n<image>"

Every magnet has two poles: north and south.\nHere are some examples of magnets. The north pole of each magnet is labeled N, and the south pole is labeled S.\nIf opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.\nIf the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.\n To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.\nThe south pole of one magnet is closest to the north pole of the other magnet.

In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.\nTo compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents.

For example:\n1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15\nTo multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:\n1.43 x 10^15 \u00b7 1000\n= 1.43 x 10^15 \u00b7 10^3\n= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)\n= 1.43 x 10^18\n To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of 10,000 times the volume of Mars.\nThen compare the result to the volume of Jupiter. Jupiter's volume is 1.43 x 10^15 km^3, which is less than 1.63 x 10^15 km^3. So, Jupiter's volume is less than 10,000 times as large as the volume of Mars. The answer is B."

Pollination is what happens when wind blows pollen from male cones onto female cones. After pollination, sperm from the pollen can combine with eggs. This is called fertilization. The fertilized eggs grow into seeds.\nThe seeds can fall out of the cones and land on the ground. When a seed lands on the ground, it can germinate, or start to grow into a new plant. When pollen lands on a female cone, it is called pollination. This photograph shows wind blowing pollen from the male cones on a Japanese cedar tree.\nAfter a female cone is pollinated, its eggs can be fertilized.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring that do or do not have horns, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the horns trait. The question tells you that the h allele, which is for having horns, is recessive to the H allele, which is for not having horns.\nHaving horns is the recessive allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the recessive version of the horns trait must have only recessive alleles for the horns gene. So, offspring that have horns must have the genotype hh.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype hh.\nNot having horns is the dominant allele's version of the horns trait. A cow with the dominant version of the horns trait must have at least one dominant allele for the horns gene. So, offspring that do not have horns must have the genotype HH or Hh.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype HH or Hh.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring that have horns to offspring that do not have horns is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring that have horns. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring that do not have horns.

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nSebastian was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Sebastian put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour (C) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\n<image>"

She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds. The answer is A."

For example:\n1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15\nTo multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:\n1.43 x 10^15 \u00b7 1000\n= 1.43 x 10^15 \u00b7 10^3\n= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)\n= 1.43 x 10^18\n To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of 100 times the volume of Earth.\nThen compare the result to the volume of Neptune. The volume of Neptune is 6.25 x 10^13 km^3, which is less than 1.08 x 10^14 km^3. So, Neptune's volume is less than 100 times as large as Earth's. The answer is A."

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nMason was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Mason put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (B) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\n<image>"

She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with yellow fruit or red fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit color trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for red fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for yellow fruit.\nYellow fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit color trait. A tomato plant with the recessive version of the fruit color trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit color gene.

So, offspring with red fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with yellow fruit to offspring with red fruit is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with yellow fruit. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with red fruit. The answer is D."

She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids are thicker than others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. The oxygen you breathe is a gas.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with mutated antennae or normal antennae, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the antenna type trait. The question tells you that the A allele, which is for mutated antennae, is dominant over the a allele, which is for normal antennae.\nMutated antennae is the dominant allele's version of the antenna type trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the antenna type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the antenna type gene. So, offspring with mutated antennae must have the genotype AA or Aa.\nThere are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype AA or Aa. These boxes are highlighted below.\nNormal antennae is the recessive allele's version of the antenna type trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the antenna type trait must have only recessive alleles for the antenna type gene. So, offspring with normal antennae must have the genotype aa.\nThere is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype aa. This box is highlighted below.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with mutated antennae to offspring with normal antennae is 3:1. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 3 offspring with mutated antennae for every 1 offspring with normal antennae. The answer is C."

For example, snails and clams make their shells. Because they are made by organisms, body parts cannot be minerals or rocks.\nHumans are organisms too.

Instead, all rocks are mixtures.\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.\nHowever, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure.

Dumbo ears are also set on the sides of the rat's head instead of on the top. The word dumbo comes from the name of a cartoon elephant whose ears had a similar appearance.\nIn a group of rats, some individuals have normal ears and others have dumbo ears. In this group, the gene for the ear type trait has two alleles. The allele for normal ears (E) is dominant over the allele for dumbo ears (e).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two rats.\nOptions: (A) 3:1 (B) 0:4 (C) 2:2 (D) 4:0 (E) 1:3\n<image>"

        "value": "Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with dumbo ears or normal ears, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for normal ears, is dominant over the e allele, which is for dumbo ears.\nDumbo ears is the recessive allele's version of the ear type trait. A rat with the recessive version of the ear type trait must have only recessive alleles for the ear type gene. So, offspring with dumbo ears must have the genotype ee.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ee.\nNormal ears is the dominant allele's version of the ear type trait. A rat with the dominant version of the ear type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the ear type gene. So, offspring with normal ears must have the genotype EE or Ee.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype EE or Ee.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with dumbo ears to offspring with normal ears is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with dumbo ears. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with normal ears. The answer is B."

When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving.

A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.\nSo, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal. Look at the diagram again.

When magnets are closer together, the magnetic force between them is stronger.\nThe magnets in Pair 1 are closer together than the magnets in Pair 2. So, the magnetic force is stronger in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. The answer is B."

Fruit flies with vestigial wings cannot fly, so they are easier for scientists to handle and study.\nIn a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings. In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies.\nOptions: (A) 1/4 (B) 3/4 (C) 2/4 (D) 0/4 (E) 4/4\n<image>"

        "value": "Offspring phenotypes: dominant or recessive?\nHow do you determine an organism's phenotype for a trait? Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4. The answer is E."

The magnitude of the magnetic force is greater when there is a smaller distance between the magnets. Distance affects the magnitude of the magnetic force. When there is a smaller distance between magnets, the magnitude of the magnetic force between them is greater.\nThere is a smaller distance between the magnets in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is greater in Pair 2 than in Pair 1. The answer is C."

Large quantities such as this are often written in scientific notation.\nFor example, the volume of Jupiter is 1,430,000,000,000,000 km^3. In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.\nTo compare two numbers written in scientific notation, compare their exponents.

For example:\n1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15\n To decide which planet is the smallest, look at the volumes shown in the table and compare the exponents.

Then answer the question.\n\nHawk moths visit many types of plants to find nectar, including petunias. Petunias produce nectar deep inside their flowers. To reach the nectar, a moth puts its long, tubular mouthpart, called a proboscis, inside a flower. While the moth drinks nectar, pollen from the flower sticks to the moth's head and proboscis.\nLater, the moth visits another petunia flower to drink more nectar. When pollen on the moth's head and proboscis is transferred to the female part of the other flower, that flower is pollinated.

Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.\nScientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.\nIn a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element. The legend shows the color and the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance. Use the model to determine whether phosphine is an elementary substance or a compound.\nStep 1: Interpret the model.\n.\nUse the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.\nYou can see from the model that a molecule of phosphine is composed of three hydrogen atoms and one phosphorus atom bonded together.\nStep 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.\nYou know from Step 1 that phosphine is composed of two chemical elements: hydrogen and phosphorus. Since phosphine is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, phosphine is a compound. The answer is A."

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.

        "value": "The outer layer of Earth is broken up into many pieces called tectonic plates, or simply plates. The breaks between plates are called plate boundaries. Plate boundaries are classified by the way the plates are moving relative to each other:\nAt a divergent boundary, two plates are moving away from each other.\nAt a transform boundary, two plates are sliding past each other.\nAt a convergent boundary, two plates are moving toward each other.\nocean-continent subduction zone\nOne type of convergent boundary is an ocean-continent subduction zone, which forms when a plate with oceanic crust and a plate with continental crust move toward each other. The oceanic crust subducts, or sinks, below the continental crust.\nAs the oceanic crust subducts, a deep-sea trench forms at the plate boundary. Some rock in the subducting plate melts into magma and rises toward the surface. The magma cools and hardens to create a string of volcanoes called a volcanic arc. To figure out what type of plate boundary formed the Cascade Range, you need to know how the tectonic plates interacted. To find this out, read the passage carefully.\nThe Cascade Range is a volcanic arc in the Pacific Northwest that begins in California and runs north into British Columbia. As the North American Plate and the Juan de Fuca Plate move toward each other, oceanic crust of the Juan de Fuca Plate subducts, or sinks, below continental crust of the North American Plate.\nThere are eighteen volcanoes in the Cascade Range, and some of them are still active. Mount St. Helens is an active volcano near Seattle, Washington. It last erupted in May of 1980.\nThe underlined part of the passage explains that the Cascade Range formed as the two plates moved toward each other. So, the Cascade Range formed at a convergent boundary. The answer is C."

In scientific notation, Jupiter's volume is written as 1.43 x 10^15 km^3.\nTo compare two numbers written in scientific notation, first compare their exponents. The bigger the exponent is, the bigger the number is. For example:\n1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.43 x 10^12\nIf their exponents are equal, compare the first numbers. For example:\n1.43 x 10^15 is larger than 1.25 x 10^15\nTo multiply a number written in scientific notation by a power of 10, write the multiple of 10 as 10 raised to an exponent. Then, add the exponents. For example:\n1.43 x 10^15 \u00b7 1000\n= 1.43 x 10^15 \u00b7 10^3\n= 1.43 x 10^(15 + 3)\n= 1.43 x 10^18\n To determine if this statement is true, calculate the value of ten times the volume of Mercury.\nThen compare the result to the volume of Earth.

These pulls and pushes between magnets are called magnetic forces.\nThe strength of a force is called its magnitude. The greater the magnitude of the magnetic force between two magnets, the more strongly the magnets attract or repel each other.\nYou can change the magnitude of a magnetic force between two magnets by using magnets of different sizes. The magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller when the magnets are smaller. The magnets in Pair 2 attract. The magnets in Pair 1 repel. But whether the magnets attract or repel affects only the direction of the magnetic force. It does not affect the magnitude of the magnetic force.\nMagnet sizes affect the magnitude of the magnetic force. Imagine magnets that are the same shape and made of the same material. The smaller the magnets, the smaller the magnitude of the magnetic force between them.\nMagnet A is the same size in both pairs. But Magnet B is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. So, the magnitude of the magnetic force is smaller in Pair 1 than in Pair 2. The answer is B."

Solute particles move from the area where they are at a higher concentration to the area where they are at a lower concentration. This movement happens through the process of diffusion.\nAs a result of diffusion, the concentration of solute particles becomes equal throughout the solution. When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.\nMembranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.\nSo, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration. At equilibrium, the concentration on both sides of the membrane is equal. Look at the diagram again. It shows you how the solution changed during the process of diffusion.\nBefore the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 4 solute particles on the left side of the membrane and 2 solute particles on the right side of the membrane.\nWhen the solute particles reached equilibrium, there were 3 solute particles on each side of the membrane. There was 1 more solute particle on the right side of the membrane than before.\nSo, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more solute particles must have moved across the membrane to the right than to the left.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black eyes or red eyes, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. The question tells you that the E allele, which is for red eyes, is dominant over the e allele, which is for black eyes.\nBlack eyes is the recessive allele's version of the eye color trait. A koi fish with the recessive version of the eye color trait must have only recessive alleles for the eye color gene.

A koi fish with the dominant version of the eye color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the eye color gene. So, offspring with red eyes must have the genotype EE or Ee.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype EE or Ee.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with black eyes to offspring with red eyes is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with black eyes. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with red eyes. The answer is B."

When this happens, the solute particles reach equilibrium. At equilibrium, the solute particles do not stop moving. But their concentration throughout the solution stays the same.\nMembranes, or thin boundaries, can divide solutions into parts. A membrane is permeable to a solute when particles of the solute can pass through gaps in the membrane. In this case, solute particles can move freely across the membrane from one side to the other.\nSo, for the solute particles to reach equilibrium, more particles will move across a permeable membrane from the side with a higher concentration of solute particles to the side with a lower concentration.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a yellow ground spot or a white ground spot, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the ground spot color trait. The question tells you that the g allele, which is for a white ground spot, is recessive to the G allele, which is for a yellow ground spot.\nA yellow ground spot is the dominant allele's version of the ground spot color trait. A watermelon plant with the dominant version of the ground spot color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the ground spot color gene. So, offspring with a yellow ground spot must have the genotype GG or Gg.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype GG or Gg.\nA white ground spot is the recessive allele's version of the ground spot color trait. A watermelon plant with the recessive version of the ground spot color trait must have only recessive alleles for the ground spot color gene. So, offspring with a white ground spot must have the genotype gg.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a yellow ground spot to offspring with a white ground spot is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a yellow ground spot. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a white ground spot.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff.

The equator is the line located at 0\u00b0 latitude. We start counting degrees from there.\nLines north of the equator are labeled N for north. Lines south of the equator are labeled S for south. Lines of latitude are also called parallels because each line is parallel to the equator.\nLines of longitude are also called meridians. They show how far east or west a place is. We use degrees to help describe how far a place is from the prime meridian. The prime meridian is the line located at 0\u00b0 longitude. Lines west of the prime meridian are labeled W. Lines east of the prime meridian are labeled E. Meridians meet at the north and south poles.\nThe equator goes all the way around the earth, but the prime meridian is different. It only goes from the North Pole to the South Pole on one side of the earth. On the opposite side of the globe is another special meridian. It is labeled both 180\u00b0E and 180\u00b0W.\nTogether, lines of latitude and lines of longitude form a grid. You can use this grid to find the exact location of a place. The prime meridian is the line at 0\u00b0 longitude. It intersects Africa. It does not intersect Australia or Asia. The answer is A."

This type of boundary forms when two plates with continental crust move toward each other. The collision compresses and folds the continental crust, forcing it upward to form a mountain range.

This plate motion formed many mountain ranges, including the Western Alps. The Western Alps run through European countries, including France, Italy, and Switzerland.\nThe underlined part of the passage explains that the Western Alps formed as the two plates collided, or ran into each other.

Scientists use fossils to learn more about the traits of ancient organisms.\nFossils can preserve the remains of body parts and activities. A fossil of a body part, such as a tail or a wing, can tell you what an organism looked like. A fossil of an organism's activities, such as a burrow or a footprint, can tell you about the organism's behavior.\nHere are three examples of fossils and the traits that you can observe from them:\nThis is a fossil of an animal. This fossil tells you that the animal had a spiral-shaped shell.\nThis is a fossil of a plant. This fossil tells you that the plant had small leaves arranged in a branched pattern.\nThis is a fossil of an animal's footprint. This fossil tells you that the animal could walk on land.\nAn organism's fossil may not show all of the organism's traits. This is because most body parts are destroyed during fossil formation. When an organism's body turns into a fossil, only a few body parts are usually preserved. The answer is A."

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4. The answer is E."

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nKenji was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Kenji put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.\nOptions: (A) if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour (B) how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour (C) whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\n<image>"

Dolphins whistle, birds sing, and wolves howl. In recent years, researchers have paid more attention to animal \"languages,\" and they have made some surprising discoveries. Egyptian fruit bats, for example, have a very complex way of talking to one another. In fact, they are one of the few animals that direct their calls to another individual. Most animals make calls to their entire group. Bats can also share more complex information than other animals. This is because they have special sounds to communicate specific issues.\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University in Israel wanted to learn more about what bats are really saying to one another. First, scientist Yossi Yovel and his team recorded sound and video of twenty-two bats. Fifteen thousand bat calls were collected over a period of seventy-five days. Then, the researchers tried to match each bat call with a behavior. They used special software to help them tell different bat calls apart and decipher the bats' messages.\nWhat Yovel and his team found was astonishing. Egyptian fruit bats are not just making squeaky noises; they are expressing very distinct concerns. One type of call means the bats are arguing over food. Another type of call means the bats are figuring out where they are going to sleep. A third call is used when one bat has gotten too close to another.\nThe researchers made another startling discovery. A bat can alter the sound of its call when addressing different members of the group. This is similar to how humans may use a different tone of voice when speaking to different people. It turns out that bats use language as a way to communicate their needs to each other, almost like humans do.\nOptions: (A) They can communicate with many kinds of animals.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.

There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4. The answer is A."

Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

A genus is a group of organisms that share many traits.\nA genus is made up of one or more species. A species is a group of very similar organisms. The second word in an organism's scientific name tells you its species within its genus.\nTogether, the two parts of an organism's scientific name identify its species. For example Ursus maritimus and Ursus americanus are two species of bears. They are part of the same genus, Ursus. But they are different species within the genus. Ursus maritimus has the species name maritimus. Ursus americanus has the species name americanus.\nBoth bears have small round ears and sharp claws. But Ursus maritimus has white fur and Ursus americanus has black fur.\n A Burmese python's scientific name is Python bivittatus. The first word of its scientific name is Python.\nThis organism and the Burmese python are in the same genus and the same species! Both organisms have the same scientific name, Python bivittatus.\nLithobates palustris is in the genus Lithobates. The first word of its scientific name is Lithobates. So, Lithobates palustris and Python bivittatus are not in the same genus.\nMelanoplus bivittatus and Python bivittatus are not in the same genus.\nThese organisms are not in the same genus, but part of their scientific names is the same. Melanoplus bivittatus and Python bivittatus have the same species name within their genus, bivittatus. But the first words of their scientific names are different.

Rose plants with climbing growth have long, bendable stems that act like vines. These plants may grow upward to cover fences or walls. Rose plants with bush growth stay near the ground. These plants form low bushes or shrubs.\nIn a group of rose plants, some individuals have climbing growth and others have bush growth. In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two rose plants.\nOptions: (A) 2:2 (B) 0:4 (C) 1:3 (D) 3:1 (E) 4:0\n<image>"

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with climbing growth or bush growth, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. The question tells you that the g allele, which is for bush growth, is recessive to the G allele, which is for climbing growth.\nClimbing growth is the dominant allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the dominant version of the growth pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with climbing growth must have the genotype GG or Gg.\nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype GG or Gg. These boxes are highlighted below.\nBush growth is the recessive allele's version of the growth pattern trait. A rose plant with the recessive version of the growth pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the growth pattern gene. So, offspring with bush growth must have the genotype gg.\nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype gg. These boxes are highlighted below.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with climbing growth to offspring with bush growth is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with climbing growth for every 2 offspring with bush growth. The answer is A."

The north pole of each magnet is labeled N, and the south pole is labeled S.\nIf opposite poles are closest to each other, the magnets attract. The magnets in the pair below attract.\nIf the same, or like, poles are closest to each other, the magnets repel. The magnets in both pairs below repel.\n To predict if these magnets will attract or repel, look at which poles are closest to each other.\nThe north pole of one magnet is closest to the south pole of the other magnet. Opposite poles attract. So, these magnets will attract each other. The answer is A."

Other fossils, such as footprints or burrows, are formed from traces of an organism's activities.\nFossils are typically found in sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks usually form in layers. Over time, new layers are added on top of old layers in a series called a rock sequence. The layers in an undisturbed rock sequence are in the same order as when they formed. So, the deeper layers are older than the shallower layers.\nThe relative ages of fossils can be determined from their positions in an undisturbed rock sequence. Older fossils are usually in deeper layers, and younger fossils are usually in shallower layers. Look again at the fossils in the rock sequence diagram.\nCompare the positions of these fossils to determine which one is older:\nThe wood fossil is in a deeper layer in the rock sequence than the palm leaf fossil. So, the wood fossil is most likely older than the palm leaf fossil. The answer is A."

Instead, all rocks are mixtures.\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.\nHowever, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure.

Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested.

How can you determine what a test can show? You need to figure out what was tested and what was measured.\nImagine an engineer needs to design a bridge for a windy location. She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria. The test described above can show whether the bridge would move too much in high winds. The answer is C."

So, the experiment described above can answer questions about how soil type affects plant height.\nExamples of questions that this experiment can answer include:\nDoes soil type affect the height of daffodil plants?\nDo daffodil plants in sandy soil grow taller than daffodil plants in clay soil?\nAre daffodil plants grown in sandy soil shorter than daffodil plants grown in clay soil? The answer is A."

Minerals are pure substances, but rocks are not. Instead, all rocks are mixtures.\nA mineral has a fixed crystal structure, but a rock does not.\nThe crystal structure of a substance tells you how the atoms or molecules in the substance are arranged. Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.\nHowever, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with white spots or solid coloring, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. The question tells you that the a allele, which is for white spots, is recessive to the A allele, which is for solid coloring.\nWhite spots is the recessive allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A cow with the recessive version of the coat pattern trait must have only recessive alleles for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with white spots must have the genotype aa.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype aa.\nSolid coloring is the dominant allele's version of the coat pattern trait. A cow with the dominant version of the coat pattern trait must have at least one dominant allele for the coat pattern gene. So, offspring with solid coloring must have the genotype AA or Aa.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype AA or Aa.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with white spots to offspring with solid coloring is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with white spots. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with solid coloring.

Chemical elements make up all of the substances around you.\nA substance may be composed of one chemical element or multiple chemical elements. Substances that are composed of only one chemical element are elementary substances. Substances that are composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together are compounds.\nEvery chemical element is represented by its own atomic symbol. An atomic symbol may consist of one capital letter, or it may consist of a capital letter followed by a lowercase letter. For example, the atomic symbol for the chemical element boron is B, and the atomic symbol for the chemical element chlorine is Cl.\nScientists use different types of models to represent substances whose atoms are bonded in different ways. One type of model is a ball-and-stick model. The ball-and-stick model below represents a molecule of the compound boron trichloride.\nIn a ball-and-stick model, the balls represent atoms, and the sticks represent bonds. Notice that the balls in the model above are not all the same color. Each color represents a different chemical element. The legend shows the color and the atomic symbol for each chemical element in the substance. Use the model to determine whether carbon tetrachloride is an elementary substance or a compound.\nStep 1: Interpret the model.\n.\nUse the legend to determine the chemical element represented by each color. The colors and atomic symbols from the legend are shown in the table below. The table also includes the names of the chemical elements represented in the model.\nYou can see from the model that a molecule of carbon tetrachloride is composed of one carbon atom and four chlorine atoms bonded together.\nStep 2: Determine whether the substance is an elementary substance or a compound.\nYou know from Step 1 that carbon tetrachloride is composed of two chemical elements: carbon and chlorine. Since carbon tetrachloride is composed of multiple chemical elements bonded together, carbon tetrachloride is a compound. The answer is B."

Different types of minerals have different crystal structures, but all minerals have a fixed crystal structure. This means that the atoms and molecules in different pieces of the same type of mineral are always arranged the same way.\nHowever, rocks do not have a fixed crystal structure.

She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

But over time, the filter would become clogged with bacteria. If the filter became clogged, the water would not move through quickly enough.

So, during his inspection, Darnell checked the filter by measuring how quickly water moved through it.\nFigure: an engineer at a water treatment plant.\nOptions: (A) whether an inexpensive filter would become clogged more often (B) whether the filter was clogged (C) the amount of bacteria in the water before it was filtered\n<image>"

She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a golden body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a gray body.\nA gray body is the dominant allele's version of the body color trait.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIn a Punnett square, each box represents a different outcome, or result. Each of the four outcomes is equally likely to happen. Each box represents one way the parents' alleles can combine to form an offspring's genotype. Because there are four boxes in the Punnett square, there are four possible outcomes.\nAn event is a set of one or more outcomes. The probability of an event is a measure of how likely the event is to happen. This probability is a number between 0 and 1, and it can be written as a fraction:\nprobability of an event = number of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes\nYou can use a Punnett square to calculate the probability that a cross will produce certain offspring. For example, the Punnett square below has two boxes with the genotype Ff. It has one box with the genotype FF and one box with the genotype ff. This means there are two ways the parents' alleles can combine to form Ff. There is one way they can combine to form FF and one way they can combine to form ff.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nConsider an event in which this cross produces an offspring with the genotype ff. The probability of this event is given by the following fraction:\nnumber of ways the event can happen / number of equally likely outcomes = number of boxes with the genotype ff / total number of boxes = 1 / 4.

She wants to make sure the bridge will not move too much in high wind. So, she builds a smaller prototype, or model, of a bridge. Then, she exposes the prototype to high winds and measures how much the bridge moves.\nFirst, identify what was tested. A test can examine one design, or it may compare multiple prototypes to each other. In the test described above, the engineer tested a prototype of a bridge in high wind.\nThen, identify what the test measured. One of the criteria for the bridge was that it not move too much in high winds. The test measured how much the prototype bridge moved.\nTests can show how well one or more designs meet the criteria.

Fruit flies with vestigial wings cannot fly, so they are easier for scientists to handle and study.\nIn a group of fruit flies, some individuals have normal wings and others have vestigial wings. In this group, the gene for the wing type trait has two alleles. The allele for vestigial wings (n) is recessive to the allele for normal wings (N).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two fruit flies.\nOptions: (A) 1:3 (B) 4:0 (C) 3:1 (D) 2:2 (E) 0:4\n<image>"

Look at the combination of alleles in the organism's genotype for the gene that affects that trait. Some alleles have types called dominant and recessive. These two types can cause different versions of the trait to appear as the organism's phenotype.\nIf an organism's genotype has at least one dominant allele for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the dominant allele's version of the gene's trait.\nIf an organism's genotype has only recessive alleles for a gene, the organism's phenotype will be the recessive allele's version of the gene's trait.\nA Punnett square shows what types of offspring a cross can produce. The expected ratio of offspring types compares how often the cross produces each type of offspring, on average. To write this ratio, count the number of boxes in the Punnett square representing each type.\nFor example, consider the Punnett square below.\n | F | f\nF | FF | Ff\nf | Ff | ff\nThere is 1 box with the genotype FF and 2 boxes with the genotype Ff. So, the expected ratio of offspring with the genotype FF to those with Ff is 1:2.\n To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with vestigial wings or normal wings, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the wing type trait. The question tells you that the n allele, which is for vestigial wings, is recessive to the N allele, which is for normal wings.\nVestigial wings is the recessive allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the recessive version of the wing type trait must have only recessive alleles for the wing type gene. So, offspring with vestigial wings must have the genotype nn.\nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype nn. These boxes are highlighted below.\nNormal wings is the dominant allele's version of the wing type trait. A fruit fly with the dominant version of the wing type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the wing type gene. So, offspring with normal wings must have the genotype NN or Nn.\nThere are 2 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype NN or Nn. These boxes are highlighted below.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with vestigial wings to offspring with normal wings is 2:2. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 2 offspring with vestigial wings for every 2 offspring with normal wings. The answer is D."

        "value": "Solid, liquid, and gas are states of matter. Matter is anything that takes up space. Matter can come in different states, or forms.\nWhen matter is a solid, it has a definite volume and a definite shape. So, a solid has a size and shape of its own.\nSome solids can be easily folded, bent, or broken. A piece of paper is a solid. Also, some solids are very small. A grain of sand is a solid.\nWhen matter is a liquid, it has a definite volume but not a definite shape. So, a liquid has a size of its own, but it does not have a shape of its own. Think about pouring juice from a bottle into a cup. The juice still takes up the same amount of space, but it takes the shape of the bottle.\nSome liquids do not pour as easily as others. Honey and milk are both liquids. But pouring honey takes more time than pouring milk.\nWhen matter is a gas, it does not have a definite volume or a definite shape. A gas expands, or gets bigger, until it completely fills a space. A gas can also get smaller if it is squeezed into a smaller space.\nMany gases are invisible. Air is a gas. Chocolate syrup is a liquid. A liquid takes the shape of any container it is in.\nIf you pour chocolate syrup into a container, the chocolate syrup will take the shape of that container. But the chocolate syrup will still take up the same amount of space. The answer is B."
